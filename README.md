# D16 CPU
This is a simple(ish) 16 bit cpu formed in a collaboration between C-Elegans, flaviaut, and pmathbraniac.
The cpu is a load-store architecture, with variable length instructions (multiples of 16 bits) and 7 GP registers.
The cpu is written in VHDL and is simulatable with GHDL.


## D16 Assembler
The included assembler is written in C, and uses bison and flex for parsing. It's not of the best quality, but it works.


It can be built on OS X by:

```
cd assembler
xcodebuild
```

and on linux by:

```
cd assembler/d16-asm
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
#optional
make check
```

A general layout of the CPU is provided here, this is subject to change during the project

The CPU's execution cycle takes 5 cycles for most instructions, 6 cycles for memory, and 7 for jumps

## Module testbenches
All testbenches can be run from the makefile in `vhdl/build/`
The makefile assumes that you have both GHDL and gtkwave installed and in your path. 
GHDL is required to simulate the vhdl files.
Gtkwave is required to view the waveforms generated by the testbench.

To list all testbenches, run `make tests-list`. 
To run one testbench, run `make` followed by the testbench name.
To run all testbenches, run `make tests`.
